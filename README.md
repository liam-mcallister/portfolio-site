## 1. Description

This is my portfolio site which allows me to showcase some of my projects and the skills that I have attained while developing them.

Potential employers and recruiters are easily able to see what technologies I have used to create each of the listed projects, navigate to my Linkedin and GitHub accounts and download a copy of my CV.

The contact form on this site previously used Elfsight but after checking the load speed on Googleâ€™s PageSpeed Insights I discovered that the third party code Elfsight had injected into the page greatly increased loading times. As a result I decided to host the site with Netlify and take advantage of their inbuilt form handling. This has decreased loading times from 4 seconds to half a second.
